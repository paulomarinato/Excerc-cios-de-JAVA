Exercício 04 - JAVA;

Consider a string, S, that is a series of characters, each followed by its frequency as an integer. The string is not compressed correctly, so there may be multiple occurrences of the same character. A properly compressed string will consist of one instance of each character in alphabetical order followed by the total count of that character within the string.

Example

The string 'a3c9b2c1' has two instances where 'c' is followed by a count: once with 9 occurrences, and again with 1. It should be compressed to 'a3b2c10'
