Complete the implementation of an autocorrect function. Given a search query string, the function should return all words which are anagrams.

Given 2 arrays, words[n], and queries[q], for each query, return an array of the strings that are anagrams, sorted alphabetically ascending.

Note: An anagram is any string that can be formed by rearranging the letters of a string.

Example

n=4, q=2 words=["duel", "speed", "dule", "cars"], queries-spede", "deul").

The only anagram of "spede" is "speed".

Both "duel" and "dule" are anagrams of "deul".

Return [["speed"], ["duel", "dule"]].
